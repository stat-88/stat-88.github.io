title: Week 12 Preparation Guide
---

Please do the required reading before attempting problems. Not only does it contain the material you need for the week's work, and more examples than in the lectures, it will remind you of the details that you have to keep in mind when attempting problems. You will solve problems faster if you read first.

### Reading ###
The course follows the textbook in sequence. So you will always know which chapters are going to be covered: start where you left off in the previous week, and compare the [home page calendar](http://prob140.org/) with the [Table of Contents](http://prob140.org/textbook/chapters/README) to see where to stop.

Lectures will cover Chapters 20 and 21 this week.

**Highly Recommended:** Pitman Section 6.3 (pages 417-422)


### Practice Problems ###
The goal of practice is for you to figure out how to get started on a solution and see it through to the end. To achieve this, you have to be prepared to go over the background reading and examples and then mess around with the ideas **yourself** to come up with steps that will lead to a solution. It will not be achieved if you just read solutions created by others.

[Further Review Exercises](http://prob140.org/textbook/chapters/Chapter_25/05_Further_Review_Exercises) consist of several problems on the material of Chapters 19 onwards. Those chapters build on the previous ones, so you have to be familiar with the previous chapters as well.

Exercises 2, 5, 6 

### Sections ###
In section you will work on practice problems and also on the week's lab if needed. The proportion of time spent on the two activities will depend on the relative demands of the lab and the week's theory.

The focus will be on approaches to problem-solving. So for example you might develop clear outlines for how to solve several problems, instead of finding the detailed answers to just a few.

There is a quiz this week so this list is short. Some time in sections will be spent on the week's lab.
